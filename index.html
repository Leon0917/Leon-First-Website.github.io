     I am a thirty two (32) years old virgo, who enjoys reading, listening to music, playing soccer, going out to eat and I also like to travel. I was born and raise in the parish of St. Elizabeth in the country of Jamaica, here I went to Maggotty High School in the said parish, graduating with a High School Diploma in the field of Business Administration; Five (5) Secondary School Certificates (SSC) and three (3) Caribbean Examination Counsel (CXC). After leaving high school I achieved an additional three (3) CXC's including a distinction in Information Technology. <br><br>  
     In the year 2007 I maigrated to Negril Jamaica where I worked as server and a bartender at the Tree House. In the year 2015 I switched careers and became a police officer, I worked in this capacity for four years and a few months. During my short tenure as a police I achieved several awards to include the title of "Detective Constable" where I investigated fincial crimes. In 2019, I resigned and migrated to California United States. Since migrating here I have been enrolled in schools while waiting on my immigration documents to come through, I have so far achieved my Mixology, TIPS, Events Bartending Certifates for my bartending career, connected with army recruiters on weekly bases doing workout sessions, in the process of doing my high School Diploma and last but definatley not least attending the coding Boot Camp at UC Berkeley Extension.</p>
